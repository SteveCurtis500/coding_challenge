Latitude Coding Challenge solution

In addition to the Unit tests, the solution was tested using Postman.
This is an example of the raw JSON format of the StockRequest body:-

{
    "requestId": "1",
    "startDateTime": "2021-08-11T01:00:00",
    "endDateTime": "2021-08-11T23:59:00",
    "stockprices":[
        4,
        6,
        1
    ]
}
